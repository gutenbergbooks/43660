  />T is now thirteen years since the first edition of the following text
  of this important poem was published by the late Mr. Pickering, during
  which time the study of our old literature and history has undergone
  considerable development, and it is believed that a reprint at a more
  moderate price would be acceptable to the public. Holding still the same
  opinion which he has always held with regard to the superior character of
  the manuscript from which this text was taken, the editor has done no
  more than carefully reprint it, but, in order to make it as useful as he
  could, he has revised and made additions to both the Notes and the
  Glossary.</p>

  <p>The remarkable poem of The Vision of Piers Ploughman is not only so
  interesting a monument of the English language and literature, but it is
  also so important an illustration of the political history of our country
  during the fourteenth century, that it deserves to be read far more
  generally than it has been, and the editor will rejoice sincerely if he
  should have contributed by this new edition to render it more popular,
  and place it within the reach of a greater number of readers. Independent
  of its historical and literary importance, it contains many beauties
  which will fully repay the slight labour required to master its partially
  obsolete language, and, as one of the purest works in the English tongue
  as it existed during the century in which it was composed, it is to be
  hoped that, when the time shall at length arrive when English antiquities
  and English philology and literary history are at length to be made a
  part of the studies in our universities and in the higher classes of our
  schools, the work of the Monk of Malvern, as a link between the poetry
  and language of the Anglo-Saxon and those of modern England, will be made
  a prominent text-book.</p>

  />HE History of the Middle Ages in England, as in other countries,
  represents to us a series of great consecutive political movements,
  coexistent with a similar series of intellectual revolutions in the mass
  of the people. The vast mental development caused by the universities in
  the twelfth century led the way for the struggle to obtain religious and
  political liberty in the thirteenth. The numerous political songs of that
  period which have escaped the hand of time, and above all the mass of
  satirical ballads against the Church of Rome, which commonly go under the
  name of Walter Mapes, are remarkable monuments of the intellectual
  history of our forefathers. Those ballads are written in Latin; for it
  was the most learned class of the community which made the first great
  stand against the encroachments and corruptions of the papacy and the
  increasing influence of the monks. We know that the struggle alluded to
  was historically unsuccessful. The baronial wars ended in the entire
  destruction of the popular leaders; but their cause did not expire at
  Evesham; they had laid foundations which no storm could overthrow, not
  placed hastily on the uncertain surface of popular favour, but fixed
  deeply in the public mind. The barons, who had fought so often and so
  staunchly for the great charter, had lost their power; even the learning
  of the universities had faded under the withering grasp of monachism; but
  the remembrance of the old contest remained, and what was more, its
  literature was left, the songs which had spread abroad the principles for
  which, or against which, Englishmen had fought, carried them down (a
  precious legacy) to their posterity. Society itself had undergone an
  important change; it was no longer a feudal aristocracy which held the
  destinies of the country in its iron hand. The plant which had been cut
  off took root again in another (a healthier) soil; and the intelligence
  which had lost its force in the higher ranks of society began to spread
  itself among the commons. Even in the thirteenth century, before the
  close of the baronial wars, the complaints so vigorously expressed in the
  Latin songs, had begun, both in England and France, to appear in the
  language of the people. Many of the satirical poems of Rutebeuf and other
  contemporary writers against the monks, are little more than translations
  of the Latin poems which go under the name of Walter Mapes.</p>

  <p>During the successive reigns of the first three Edwards, the public
  mind in England was in a state of constant fermentation. On the one hand,
  the monks, supported by the popish church, had become an incubus upon the
  country. Their corruptness and immorality were notorious: the description
  of their vices given in the satirical writings of the thirteenth and
  fourteenth centuries exceeds even the bitterest calumnies of the age of
  Rabelais or the reports of the commissioners of Henry the Eighth.<a
  name="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The populace, held in awe by
  the imposing appearance of the popish church, and by the religious belief
  which had been instilled into them from their infancy, were opposed to
  the monks and clergy by a multitude of personal griefs and jealousies:
  these frequently led to open hostility, and in the chronicles of those
  days we read of the slaughter of monks, and the burning of abbeys, by the
  insurgent towns-people or peasantry. At the same time, while the monks in
  revenge treated the commons with contempt, there were numerous people
  who, under the name of Lollards and other such appellations,&mdash;led
  sometimes by the love of mischief and disorder, but more frequently by
  religious enthusiasm,&mdash;whose doctrines were simple and reasonable
  (although the church would fain have branded them all with the title of
  heretics),&mdash;went abroad among the people preaching not only against
  the corruptions of the monks, but against the most vital doctrines of the
  church of Rome, and, as might be expected, they found abundance of
  listeners. On the other hand, a new political system, and the
  embarrassments of a continued series of foreign wars, were adding to the
  general ferment. Instead of merely calling together the great feudal
  barons to lead their retainers to battle, the king was now obliged to
  appeal more directly to the people; and at the same time the latter began
  to feel the weight of taxation, and consequently they began to talk of
  the defects and the corruptions of the government, and to raise the
  cries, which have since so often been heard, against the king's "evil
  advisers." These cries were justified by many real and great oppressions
  under which the commons, and more particularly the peasantry, suffered;
  and (as the king and aristocracy were too much interested in the
  continuance of the abuses complained of to be easily induced to agree to
  an effective remedy), the commons began to feel that their own interests
  were equally opposed to those of the church, of the aristocracy, and of
  the crown, and amidst the other popular doctrines none were more loudly
  or more violently espoused than those of levellers and democrats. These,
  though comparatively few, aggravated the evil, by affording a pretence
  for persecution. The history of England during the fourteenth century is
  a stirring picture; its dark side is the increasing corruption of the
  popish church; its bright side, the general spread of popular
  intelligence, and the firm stand made by the commons in the defence of
  their liberties, and in the determination to obtain a redress of
  grievances.</p>

  <p>Under these circumstances appeared <span class="sc">Piers
  Ploughman</span>. It is not to be supposed that all the other classes of
  society were hostile to the commons. The people, with the characteristic
  attachment of the Anglo-Saxons to the family of their princes, wished to
  believe that their king was always their friend, when not actuated by the
  counsels of his "evil advisers;"<a name="NtA_2"
  href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> several of the most powerful barons stood
  forward as the champions of popular liberty; and many of the monks
  quitted their monasteries to advocate the cause of the reformation. It
  appears to be generally agreed that a monk was the author of the poem of
  Piers Ploughman; but the question, one perhaps but of secondary
  importance, as to its true writer, is involved in much obscurity.<a
  name="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Several local allusions and
  other circumstances seem to prove that it was composed on the borders of
  Wales, where had originated most of the great political struggles, and we
  can hardly doubt that its author resided in the neighbourhood of
  "Malverne hilles." We have less difficulty in ascertaining its date. At
  ll. <a href="#vs1735">1735</a>-<a href="#vs1782">1782</a>, we have,
  without doubt, an allusion to the treaty of Bretigny, in 1360, and to the
  events which preceded it: in the earlier part of this passage there is an
  allusion to the sufferings of the English army in the previous winter
  campaign, to the retreat which followed, and the want of provisions which
  accompanied it, and to the tempest which they encountered near Chartres
  (the "dym cloude" of the poem). The "pestilences" mentioned at l. <a
  href="#vs2497">2497</a> were the great plague which happened in 1348-9
  (and which had previously been alluded to in the opening of the poem, l.
  <a href="#vs168">168</a>), and that of 1361-2,&mdash;the first two of the
  three great pestilences which devastated our island in the fourteenth
  century. The south-western wind, mentioned in l. <a
  href="#vs2500">2500</a>, occurred on the fifteenth day of January 1362.
  It is probable that the poem of Piers Ploughman was composed in the
  latter part of this year, when the effects of the great wind were fresh
  in people's memory, and when the treaty of Bretigny had become a subject
  of popular discontent.<a name="NtA_4" href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The poem was given to the world under a name which could not fail to
  draw the attention of the people. Amid the oppressive injustice of the
  great and the vices of their idle retainers, the corruptions of the
  clergy, and the dishonesty which too frequently characterised the
  dealings of merchants and traders, the simple unsophisticated heart of
  the ploughman is held forth as the dwelling of virtue and truth. It was
  the ploughman, and not the pope with his proud hierarchy, who represented
  on earth the Saviour who had descended into this world as the son of the
  carpenter, who had lived a life of humility, who had wandered on foot or
  ridden on an ass. "While God wandered on earth," says one of the
  political songs of the beginning of the fourteenth century,<a
  name="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> "what was the reason that he
  would not ride?" The answer expresses the whole force of the popular
  sentiment of the age: "because he would not have a retinue of greedy
  attendants by his side, in the shape of grooms and servants, to insult
  and oppress the peasantry."</p>

  <p>At the period when this poem was first published, England, in common
  with the rest of Europe, had been struck with a succession of calamities.
  Little more than twelve years had passed since a terrible pestilence had
  swept away perhaps not less than one-half of the population.<a
  name="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> The lower classes, ill fed
  and neglected, perished by thousands, while the higher ranks&mdash;the
  proud and pampered nobility&mdash;escaped; "he who was ill nourished with
  unsubstantial food," says a contemporary writer, "fell before the
  slightest breath of the destroyer; to the poor, death was welcome, for
  life is to them more cruel than death. But death respected princes,
  nobles, knights, judges, gentlemen; of these few die, because their life
  is one of enjoyment."<a name="NtA_7" href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> It
  was the general belief that this fearful visitation had been sent by God
  as a punishment for the sins which had more particularly characterised
  the higher orders of society; yet instead of profiting by the warning,
  they became, during the years which followed, prouder, more cruel and
  oppressive, and more licentious, than before. Another pestilence came,
  which visited the classes that had before escaped, and at the same time a
  tempest such as had seldom been witnessed seemed to announce the
  vengeance of heaven. The streets and roads were filled with zealots who
  preached and prophesied of other misfortunes, to people who had scarcely
  recovered from the terror of those which were past. At this moment the
  satirist stepped forth, and laid open with unsparing knife the sins and
  corruptions which provoked them.</p>

  <p>From what has been said, it will be seen that the Latin poems
  attributed to Walter Mapes, and the Collection of Political Songs, form
  an introduction to the Vision of Piers Ploughman. It seems clear that the
  writer was well acquainted with the former, and that he not unfrequently
  imitates them. The Poem on the Evil Times of Edward II. already alluded
  to (in the Political Songs) contains within a small compass all his chief
  points of accusation against the different orders of society. But a new
  mode of composition had been brought into fashion since the appearance of
  the famous "Roman de la Rose," and the author makes his attacks less
  directly, under an allegorical clothing. The condition of society is
  revealed to the writer in a dream, as in the singular poem just
  mentioned, and as in the still older satire, the <i>Apocalypsis
  Goliæ</i>; but in Piers Ploughman the allegory follows no systematic
  plot, it is rather a succession of pictures in which the allegorical
  painting sometimes disappears altogether, than a whole like the Roman de
  la Rose, and it is on that account less tedious to the modern reader,
  while the vigorous descriptions, the picturesque ideas, and numerous
  other beauties of different kinds, cause us to lose sight of the general
  defects of this class of writings.</p>

  <p>Piers Ploughman is, in fact, rather a succession of dreams, than one
  simple vision. The dreamer, weary of the world, falls asleep beside a
  stream amid the beautiful scenery of Malvern Hills. In his vision, the
  people of the world are represented to him by a vast multitude assembled
  in a fair meadow; on one side stands the tower of Truth, elevated on a
  mountain, the right aim of man's pilgrimage, while on the other side is
  the dungeon of Care, the dwelling place of Wrong. In the first sections
  (<i>passus</i>) of the poem are pictured the origin of society, the
  foundation and dignity of kingly power, and the separation into different
  classes and orders. In the midst of his astonishment at what he sees, a
  fair lady, the personification of "holy church," approaches, to instruct
  the dreamer. She explains to him the meaning of the different objects
  which had presented themselves to his view, and shows by exhortations and
  examples the merit of content and moderation, the danger of disobedience
  (exemplified in the story of Lucifer's fall), and the efficacy of love
  and charity. In the midst of his conversation with his instructor, a lady
  makes her appearance on the scene. This is lady Mede, the personification
  of that mistaken object at which so large a portion of mankind direct
  their aim&mdash;the origin of most of the corruptions and evil deeds in
  the world&mdash;not the just remuneration of our actions which we look
  forward to in a future life, but the reward which is sought by those who
  set all their hopes on the present. Holy Church now quits the dreamer,
  who is left to observe what is taking place amid the crowd in the field.
  (<a href="#passII"><i>Passus II.</i></a>) They all pay their court to
  lady Mede, who, by the intermediation of Cyvyle, or the law, is betrothed
  in marriage to Falsehood. The marriage is forbidden by Theology, and
  Cyvyle agrees to carry the cause to London for judgment, contrary to the
  desire of Simony. Falsehood and Flattery bribe the lawyers to aid the
  former in his suit, but their designs are baffled by Conscience, at whose
  suggestion the king takes the lady into his own custody, and drives away
  Falsehood and his greedy followers. Mede soon finds favour at court (<a
  href="#passIII"><i>Passus III.</i></a>), and especially with the friars,
  who are ready to absolve her of all her sins for a proper consideration.
  The king proposes to marry her to Conscience; who, however, declines the
  match, and as a reason for his refusal gives a very unfavourable picture
  of the lady's previous life and private character. Mede defends herself,
  and accuses Conscience of thwarting and opposing the will and designs of
  kings and great people. The dispute becoming hot, the king interferes and
  orders Mede and Conscience to be reconciled and kiss each other. (<a
  href="#passIV"><i>Passus IV.</i></a>) This Conscience refuses to do,
  unless by the advice of Reason; on whose arrival, Peace comes into the
  parliament to make his complaint against the cruel oppressions of Wrong.
  Wrong is condemned, but Mede and the lawyers attempt to get him off with
  the payment of a sum of money. The king, however, allows himself to be
  guided by Reason and Conscience, expresses his dissatisfaction that law
  is influenced by Mede, and his determination to govern his realm by the
  counsel of Reason.</p>

  <p>In a second vision (<a href="#passV"><i>Passus V.</i></a>), the
  dreamer is again carried to the "field full of folk," where Reason has
  taken upon himself the character of a preacher, and, fortified with the
  king's authority, induces the various classes of sinners to confess and
  repent. The personification of the different sins forms perhaps the most
  remarkable part of the whole poem. The multitude being thus converted
  from their evil courses, are persuaded by Repentance and Hope to set out
  on a pilgrimage in search of Truth. In their ignorance of the path which
  they must follow in this search, they apply to a palmer who had wandered
  over a large portion of the world in search of different saints; but they
  find him as little acquainted with the way as themselves. They are helped
  out of this dilemma by Piers the Ploughman, who, seeing them terrified by
  the difficulties of the road, offers to be their guide, if they will wait
  till he has sown his half acre. (<a href="#passVI"><i>Passus VI.</i></a>)
  In the mean time all the pilgrims who have strength and skill, are
  employed on some useful works, except the knight, who undertakes, in
  return for the support which he is to derive from the ploughman's
  labours, to watch and protect him against plunderers and foreign enemies.
  The peace of the labourers is first disturbed by Waster, who refuses to
  perform the conditions by which the others are bound: the aid of the
  knight being found inefficient against this turbulent gentleman, the
  Ploughman is obliged to send for Hunger, who effectually humbles him.
  This section of the poem is a continued allusion to the effects of the
  famine and pestilence, and a satire upon the luxurious and extravagant
  life of our forefathers in the fourteenth century. (<a
  href="#passVII"><i>Passus VII.</i></a>) Truth, hearing of the intentions
  of Piers the Ploughman to leave his labours in order to serve as a guide
  to the pilgrims in their journey, sends him a messenger, exhorting him to
  remain at home and continue his labours, and giving him a "pardon" which
  was to embrace all those who aided him honestly, by their works, and who
  should carry on their various avocations in purity of heart. The writer
  here takes occasion to sneer at the "pardons" of the pope, then so much
  in vogue; a priest questions the legitimacy of Piers' bull of pardon, and
  the altercation between them becomes so loud that the dreamer awakes. The
  pardon of Piers Ploughman is granted to those who do good works: the
  dreamer is lost in the speculation on the question as to what the good
  works are, and he becomes engaged in a new pilgrimage, in search of a
  person who has not appeared before,&mdash;Do-well.</p>

  <p>(<a href="#passVIII"><i>Passus VIII.</i></a>) All his inquiries after
  Do-well are fruitless: even the friars, to whom he addresses himself,
  give but a confused account; and, weary with wandering about, the dreamer
  is again overtaken by slumber. Thought now appears to him, and recommends
  him to Wit, who describes to him the residence of Do-well, Do-better, and
  Do-best, and enumerates their companions and attendants. (<a
  href="#passIX"><i>Passus IX.</i></a>) The Castle of Do-well is an
  allegorical representation of man (the individual), in which lady Anima
  (the soul) is placed for safety, and guarded by a keeper named Kynde
  (nature). With Do-well, the representative of those who live according to
  truth in honest wedlock, are contrasted the people who live in lust and
  wickedness, the descendants of the murderer Cain, who was begotten by
  Adam in an evil hour. (<a href="#passX"><i>Passus X.</i></a>) Wit has a
  wife named lady Study, who is angry that her spouse should lay open his
  high truths to those who are uninitiated&mdash;it is no better than
  "throwing pearls to swine, which would rather have hawes." Wit is daunted
  by his wife's long lecture, and leaves the dreamer to pursue his own
  suit. This he does with so much meekness and humility, that the wrath of
  dame Study is appeased, and she sends him to Clergy, with a token of
  recommendation from herself. Clergy receives the pilgrim, and entertains
  him with a long declamation on the character of Do-well, Do-better, and
  Do-best, and on the corruptions of the church and the monkish orders, in
  the course of which is uttered the remarkable prophecy of the king who
  was to "confess and beat" the monks, and give them an "incurable knock,"
  which was after less than two centuries so exactly fulfilled in the
  dissolution of the monasteries. The wanderer confesses himself "little
  the wiser" for Clergy's lecture, and by his pertness of reply merits a
  reproof from Scripture. (<a href="#passXI"><i>Passus XI.</i></a>) In
  another vision the dreamer is exposed to the seductions of Fortune, whose
  two fair damsels, Concupiscentia-carnis and Covetousness-of-the-Eyes,
  persuade him to enjoy the present moment, and lead him entirely from his
  previous pursuit. He is only recalled from his error by the approach of
  Old Age, and then he falls into the contemplation of a series of
  subjects, the covetousness of the friars who gave absolution from motives
  of personal interest, predestination, &amp;c. Then Kynde, or Nature, came
  and carried him to a mountain, which represented the world, and there
  showed him how all other animals but man followed Reason; and Imaginative
  came after, and told him that all his present doubt and anxiety had been
  brought upon him for contending with Reason and suffering himself to be
  led astray by Fortune. (<a href="#passXII"><i>Passus XII.</i></a>) The
  whole of the next section of the poem is occupied with a long exhortation
  by Imaginative, concerning God's chastisements, the merits of Charity and
  Mercy, the greater responsibility before God of those who are learned and
  cannot sin ignorantly, the difficulty for the rich man to enter
  heaven.</p>

  <p>(<a href="#passXIII"><i>Passus XIII.</i></a>) In another vision,
  Conscience meets with the dreamer, and takes him to dine with Clergy.
  Patience comes to the feast in beggar's weeds, but is seated in the most
  honourable place at the table. A doctor of the church is of the party,
  and distinguishes himself by his gluttony; and by discussing theological
  questions after dinner. At length Conscience and Patience go on a
  pilgrimage. In their way they meet with a minstrel, named Activa Vita, or
  Haukyn the Active-man, with a coat covered with spots of dirt, whom they
  question on his mode of life. (<a
  href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43661/43661-h/43661-h.htm#passXIV"><i>Passus
  XIV.</i></a>) Haukyn the Active-man, the representative of that class of
  people who neglect their souls for their worldly affairs, excuses the
  dirtiness of his apparel on the ground that he has none to change, and
  that he has too many occupations to allow him time to have it cleaned.
  Conscience and Patience teach him a method to clean his coat, inform him
  where charity is to be found, and recommend patient poverty to him,
  showing him the advantage of poverty over riches. Haukyn's repentance and
  lamentation for the neglect of his duties awake the dreamer.</p>

  <p>(<a
  href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43661/43661-h/43661-h.htm#passXV"><i>Passus
  XV.</i></a>) Amid his anxiety to know something more certain of Do-well,
  the dreamer has another vision, in which Soul appears to him, and enters
  into a long relation of the corruptions and negligence of the clergy. (<a
  href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43661/43661-h/43661-h.htm#passXVI"><i>Passus
  XVI.</i></a>) Soul finally sends him to Piers the Ploughman, who
  possesses the garden in which the tree of Charity grows, and which is
  rented under him by Free-will. Piers explains to him the nature of the
  tree, and of the props which support it; and shakes down some of the
  fruit for him. The allegory then changes, and we are introduced to the
  birth and passion of the Saviour, as arising out of the fruit of Charity.
  At this moment the dreamer awakes, and therewith loses sight of Piers the
  Ploughman; in his anxiety to find Piers, he meets with Faith, in the garb
  of Abraham, who was in search of God, now incarnate, and who waited for
  his passion in order to be delivered from hell. (<a
  href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43661/43661-h/43661-h.htm#passXVII"><i>Passus
  XVII.</i></a>) Then comes Spes, or Hope, who also was in search of the
  knight that was to vanquish the evil one. As they go along the way
  towards Jerusalem to the "justes," discoursing on the obligations of the
  old and new law and the abrogation of the former, they meet with a man
  who had been left helpless by thieves, wounded and naked: Faith and Hope
  passed by without helping him, but the Samaritan, who was also riding to
  the "justes," descended from his horse, bound his wounds, and deposited
  him in an inn at the grange named <i>Lex Christi</i>. The Samaritan gives
  the dreamer a singular explanation of the mysteries of the Trinity; and,
  after having represented to him the heinousness of sins against the
  different persons, and the necessity of making reparation, he pursues his
  way to Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>(<a
  href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43661/43661-h/43661-h.htm#passXVIII"><i>Passus
  XVIII.</i></a>) The vision which forms the eighteenth section or
  <i>passus</i>, and in which the character of Piers the Ploughman is
  identified with that of the Saviour, is entirely occupied with an
  allegorical description of Christ's Passion, and his descent into Hell.
  (<a
  href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43661/43661-h/43661-h.htm#passXIX"><i>Passus
  XIX.</i></a>) In the next section the history of Christ's passion and
  victory, and his figurative representative Piers the Ploughman, is
  continued. Grace, through Piers the Ploughman, descends upon the people,
  and lays the foundation of the Church, which is cultivated by Piers with
  his four oxen (the four Evangelists). Piers is attacked by Pride, who
  gathers a great host to assail the Church. Conscience advises the people
  who follow Piers (the Church), to take shelter in the stronghold of
  Unity, and make preparations for their defence. By the counsel of
  Kind-wit and Conscience they dig a great ditch around Unity. The measures
  of Surety are embarrassed by the unreasonable opposition of some members
  or parts of the community, who oppose Pier's doctrine of
  restitution&mdash;the brewer will not repent of the tricks which he puts
  on his customers, the vicar adheres to his simony, the lord will continue
  to oppress his tenants, and the king will not be restrained by his laws.
  (<i><a
  href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43661/43661-h/43661-h.htm#passXX"><i>Passus
  XX.</i></a></i>) In the last section of the poem, the dreamer, after
  having been accosted by Need, who preaches on the virtues of temperance,
  has a vision of Antichrist, who comes to attack the Castle of Unity. It
  must be remembered that at this period many people supposed that
  Antichrist was already on the earth, and that he was the cause of all the
  evils with which mankind was then visited, so that this last notion
  brought the allegory home to people's feelings. The standard-bearer of
  Antichrist was Pride. Conscience called Kynde, or Nature, to his aid, who
  brought an army of diseases and pestilences. Death, one of his chief
  soldiers, made terrible havoc. At length Kynde ceased his ravages; and a
  horde of enemies immediately arose against Conscience, such as Fortune,
  Lechery, Covetousness, Simony. Life, with his mistress Fortune, indulged
  in all kinds of excess, until he was visited by Age and Despair, who
  treated him very roughly. The dreamer, forsaken by Fortune, and
  participating in the misfortunes of Life, by the advice of Kynde takes
  shelter with Conscience in the castle of Unity, which is threatened by an
  army of priests and monks. At length this stronghold is endangered by the
  entrance of Flattery, who is admitted in the disguise of a Physician.
  Conscience, unable to retain possession, embarks upon another pilgrimage
  in search of Piers the Ploughman, and the dreamer awakes. This is the
  conclusion of the poem. Whitaker thought that it should have had a more
  consoling end; but it must be remembered that the writer of Piers
  Ploughman designed to paint the world as it was, and to describe the
  numerous obstacles which lay in the way of the improvement and
  amelioration of mankind when he wrote.</p>

  <p>While one member of the monastic order was thus contributing by his
  satirical pen towards producing a reform among his countrymen, another
  monk was beginning to preach in a still bolder manner against the popish
  system. This was John Wycliffe, under whom the despised lollards became
  an important sect. This attempt at religious reformation only formed part
  of the great movement of the fourteenth century, which soon afterwards
  broke out in the popular commotions of the reign of Richard II. The
  writer of Piers Ploughman was neither a sower of sedition, nor one who
  would be characterised by his contemporaries as a heretic. The doctrines
  inculcated throughout the book are so far from democratic, that he
  constantly preaches the Christian doctrine of obedience to rulers. Yet
  its tendency to debase the great, and to raise the commons in public
  consideration, must have rendered it popular among the latter: and,
  although no single important doctrine of the popish religion is attacked,
  yet the unsparing manner in which the vices and corruptions of the church
  are laid open, must have helped in no small degree the cause of the
  Reformation. Of the ancient popularity of Piers Ploughman we have a proof
  in the great number of copies which still exist, most of them written in
  the latter part of the fourteenth century; and the circumstance that the
  manuscripts are seldom executed in a superior style of writing, and
  scarcely ever ornamented with painted initial letters, may perhaps be
  taken as a proof that they were not written for the higher classes of
  society. From the time when it was published, the name of Piers Ploughman
  became a favourite among the popular reformers.<a name="NtA_8"
  href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> The earliest instance of the adoption of
  that name for another satirical work is found in the Creed of Piers
  Ploughman, printed also in the present volume, and in which even the form
  of verse of the Vision is imitated.</p>

  <p>In this latter poem, which was undoubtedly written by a Wycliffite,
  Piers Ploughman is no longer an allegorical personage&mdash;he is the
  simple representative of the peasant rising up to judge and act for
  himself&mdash;the English <i>sans-culotte</i> of the fourteenth century,
  if we may be allowed the comparison. When it was written, a period of
  great excitement had passed since the age of Langlande, the reputed
  author of the Vision&mdash;a period characterised by the turbulence of
  the peasantry&mdash;which had witnessed in France the fearful
  insurrection of the <i>Jacquerie</i>, and in England the rebellion of Wat
  Tyler and Jack Straw.<a name="NtA_9" href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In Piers Ploughman's Creed it is the church simply, and not the state,
  which is the object of attack. The clergy&mdash;and more particularly the
  monks&mdash;are accused of having falsified religion, and of being
  actuated solely by worldly passions&mdash;pride, covetousness, self-love.
  The writer, placing himself in the position of one who has just learnt
  the first grounds of religious knowledge, is anxious to find a person
  capable of instructing him in his creed, and with this object he
  addresses himself to the different orders of friars. He applies first to
  the Minorites, who abuse the Carmelites, and pride themselves in their
  own holiness. Disgusted with their jealousies and self-sufficiency, the
  inquirer seeks the Preachers, or Dominicans; amid their stately
  buildings, and under their sleek and well filled skins, he finds the same
  want of Christian charity: their pride drives him to the order of St.
  Austin. The Austin Friars, as well as the Carmelites, will only instruct
  him for money, and, shocked at their covetousness, he continues his
  wanderings, until at last he meets with a poor Ploughman, in whom he
  finds the charity and knowledge after which he has been seeking. The
  Ploughman enters into a bitter attack on the vices of all the four orders
  of friars: he describes their spirit of persecution, exemplified in the
  case of Wycliffe and others, and their simony; speaks of Wycliffe and
  Walter Brute as preachers of the truth; and finishes by teaching the
  inquirer his simple creed.</p>

  <p>The Creed of Piers Ploughman was written by one who approved the
  opinions of Wycliffe, and it seems to have been carefully proscribed.
  There does not appear to exist any manuscript older than the first
  printed edition.</p>

  <p>The great popularity of the Vision of Piers Ploughman in the
  fourteenth century, and its political influence, are proved by another
  close imitation, which was composed immediately after the capture, and
  previous to the deposition, of king Richard II. This poem also appears to
  have been proscribed, and we have only a fragment left, which was printed
  from an unique manuscript for the Camden Society. It also is composed in
  alliterative verse, and its meaning is rendered obscure by a confused
  allegorical style. It was evidently written towards the Welsh Border,
  perhaps at Bristol, which is mentioned in the opening lines; and it
  appears to have been intended as a continuation of, or as a sequel to,
  Piers Ploughman, which it immediately follows in the only manuscript in
  which it is preserved.</p>

  <p>Another early poem, of which the Ploughman is the hero, was inserted
  in the works of Chaucer under the title of the Ploughman's Tale. This,
  like the Creed, is free from allegory; and it differs from the others
  also in being written in rhyme, and not in alliterative verse. The
  Ploughman's Tale was probably written in the earlier half of the
  fifteenth century.<a name="NtA_10" href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> It
  is a coarse attack on the different orders of the clergy, for their
  pride, covetousness, and other vices. Its versification has little merit;
  and there appears to be no good reason for inserting it among the
  Canterbury Tales.</p>

  <p>The vision of Piers Ploughman appears to have continued to enjoy a
  wide popularity down to the middle of the fifteenth century. We hear
  nothing of it from that period to the middle of the sixteenth, when it
  was printed by the reformers, and received with so much favour, that no
  less than three editions, or rather three impressions, are said to have
  been sold in the course of one year. Another edition was printed at the
  beginning of the reign of Queen Elizabeth; and it appears to have been
  much read in the latter part of the sixteenth century, and even at the
  beginning of the seventeenth. The name of Piers Ploughman is not uncommon
  in the political tracts of that period.<a name="NtA_11"
  href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Poem of Piers Ploughman is peculiarly a national work. It is the
  most remarkable monument of the public spirit of our forefathers in the
  middle, or, as they are often termed, dark ages. It is a pure specimen of
  the English language at a period when it had sustained few of the
  corruptions which have disfigured it since we have had writers of
  "Grammars;" and in it we may study with advantage many of the
  difficulties of the language which these writers have misunderstood. It
  is, moreover, the finest example left of the kind of versification which
  was purely English, inasmuch as it had been the only one in use among our
  Anglo-Saxon progenitors, in common with the other people of the North. To
  many readers it will be perhaps necessary to explain that rhyming verse
  was not in use among the Anglo-Saxons. In place of rhyme, they had a
  system of verse of which the characteristic was a very regular
  <i>alliteration</i>, so arranged that, in every couplet, there should be
  two principal words in the first line beginning with the same letter,
  which letter must also be the initial of the first word on which the
  stress of the voice falls in the second line. There has, as yet, been
  discovered no system of foot-measure in Anglo-Saxon verse, but the common
  metre consists apparently in having two rises and two falls of the voice
  in each line. These characteristics are accurately preserved in the verse
  of Piers Ploughman; and the measure appears to be the same, if we make
  allowance for the change of the slow and impressive pronunciation of the
  Anglo-Saxon for the quicker pronunciation of Middle English, which
  therefore required a greater number of syllables to fill up the same
  space of time.</p>

  <p>We can trace the history of alliterative verse in England with
  tolerable certainty. The Anglo-Normans first brought in rhymes, which
  they employed in their own poetry. The adoption of this new system into
  the English language was gradual, but it appears to have commenced in the
  first half of the twelfth century. It was, at first, mixed with
  alliterative couplets: that is, in the same poem were used sometimes
  rhyming couplets, which were suddenly changed for alliterative couplets,
  and then, after awhile, rhyme was again brought in, and so on. Of this
  kind of poetry we have four very remarkable examples, the <i>Proverbs of
  King Alfred</i>, a poem which was certainly in existence in the first
  half of the twelfth century;<a name="NtA_12"
  href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> the <i>Early English Bestiary</i>;<a
  name="NtA_13" href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> the Poem on the <i>Debate

  href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> and the grand work of Layamon.<a
  name="NtA_15" href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> The following lines from
  the Bestiary may serve as a specimen of the manner in which the two
  systems are intermixed; they form part of the account of the spider<span

  <p>This kind of poetry appears to have been common until the middle of
  the thirteenth century; after which period we only find alliteration in
  songs, not used in simple alliterative couplets, but mixed up in the same
  lines with rhyme in an irregular and playful manner.<a name="NtA_16"
  href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> But there appears little room for
  doubting that during the whole of this time the pure alliterative poetry
  was in use among the lower classes of society; and its revival towards
  the middle of the fourteenth century appears to have been a part of the
  political movement which then took place. In this point of view, the poem
  of Piers Ploughman becomes still more worthy of attention as a document
  of contemporary literary history. The old alliterative verse came so much
  into fashion at this period that it was adopted for the composition of
  long romances, of which several still remain.<a name="NtA_17"
  href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> The use of this kind of verse was
  continued in the fifteenth century, and was imitated in Scotland as late
  as the time of Dunbar, but the later writers were evidently unacquainted
  with the strict rules of this species of composition.</p>

  <p>The Anglo-Saxons, who used this kind of verse only, wrote their poetry
  invariably as prose. But the scribe was in the habit of indicating the
  division of the lines by a dot. Among modern scholars a question has
  arisen as to the propriety of printing the alliterative couplet in two
  short lines, or in one long one. It appears to me that the mode in which
  the dot is used in the manuscripts decides the question in favour of the
  short lines. The manner in which the alliterative couplet is intermixed
  with the rhyming couplet in the poems of the twelfth and thirteenth
  centuries (which also are written in the manuscripts in the same form as
  prose), seems to me a strong confirmation of this opinion; at least in
  these last-mentioned cases, the verse must have been considered as
  written in short lines. As the scribes quitted the custom of writing
  poetry in their manuscripts as prose, with the divisions of lines
  indicated by dots, to adopt that of arranging them in lines as we do at
  present, these short lines were found very inconvenient because they were
  obliged either to waste a great deal of parchment, or to write in several
  narrow columns. To remedy this, they fell perhaps gradually into the
  custom of writing the two parts of the alliterative couplet in one line,
  always, however, marking the division by a dot. They followed the same
  method with the shorter rhyming lines, as is the case with the old
  English Metrical Romance of Horn in a manuscript in the Harleian
  Collection.<a name="NtA_18" href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> All the
  alliterative poetry of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries is found
  written in these long lines, with the dot of division in the middle. In
  the fifteenth century the meaning of this dot appears to have been
  forgotten, and the system of alliteration so far misunderstood, that the
  writers thought it only necessary to have <i>at least</i> three
  alliterative words in a long line, without any consideration of their
  position in the line. I say <i>at least</i>, because they not
  unfrequently inserted four or five alliterative words in the same line,
  which would certainly have been considered a defect in the earlier
  writers. It is my opinion, that a modern editor is wrong in printing the
  verses of Piers Ploughman in long lines, as they stand in the
  manuscripts, unless he profess to give them as a fac-simile of the
  manuscripts themselves, or he plead the same excuse of convenience from
  the shape of his book. In either case, he must carefully preserve the
  dots of separation in the middle of the lines, which are more
  inconvenient than the length of the lines, because they interfere with
  the punctuation of the modern editor. If, as appears to be the case,
  these dots are merely marks to indicate the division of the couplet,
  their purpose is much better served by printing the lines in couplets.
  The construction of the earlier Anglo-Saxon verse, the analogy of the
  mixed rhyming and alliterative verses of the semi-Saxon poems, and the
  use of these dots in the middle of the lines in the manuscripts of Piers
  Ploughman, appear to me convincing proofs that it ought to be printed so.
  I think moreover that the alliterative verse reads much more harmoniously
  in the short couplets than in the long lines.</p>

  <p>The manuscripts of the Vision of Piers Ploughman are extremely
  numerous both in public and in private collections. There are at least
  eight in the British Museum: there are ten or twelve in the Cambridge
  Libraries; and they are not less numerous at Oxford. As might be expected
  in a popular work like this, the manuscripts are in general full of
  variations; but there are two classes of manuscripts which give two texts
  that are widely different from each other, those variations commencing
  even with the first lines of the poem. One of these texts, which was
  adopted in the early printed editions, is given in the present volumes;
  the other text was selected for publication by Dr. Whitaker. The
  following extract, comprising the first lines of the poem,<a
  name="NtA_19" href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> will show how each text
  begins, and will enable those who possess manuscripts of Piers Ploughman

  <p>Besides such variations as appear in the foregoing specimen, there are
  in the second text many considerable additions, omissions, and
  transpositions. It would not be easy to account for the existence of two
  texts differing so much; but it is my impression that the first was the
  one published by the author, and that the variations were made by some
  other person, who was perhaps induced by his own political sentiments to
  modify passages, and was gradually led on to publish a revision of the
  whole. It is certain that in some parts of Text II. the strong sentiments
  or expressions of the first text are softened down. We may give as an
  example of this, the statement of the popular opinion of the origin and
  purpose of kingly government<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>Nobody, I think, can deny that in this instance the doctrine is stated
  far more distinctly and far more boldly in the first text than in the
  second. In general the first text is the best, whether we look at the
  mode in which the sentiments are stated, or at the poetry and
  language.</p>

  <p>As far as I have been able to examine the remaining manuscripts of
  Piers Ploughman, at London and in the Universities, I think that nearly
  two-thirds of those which remain are of the <i>fourteenth</i> century;
  and the greater number, particularly of those written in the fourteenth
  century, present what I have distinguished as the first text, that given
  in the present volumes. I am by no means inclined to coincide in the
  reasons which led Dr. Whitaker to prefer the second text; if I were
  disposed to admit, as barely possible (the supposition is quite a
  gratuitous one), "that the first edition of this work appeared when its
  author was a young man, and that he lived and continued in the habit of
  transcribing to extreme old age" (Pref.), I cannot agree with an editor
  in adopting a copy which he believes to be "a faithful representation of
  the work as it came first from the author," and which not only abounds in
  words and idioms which he afterwards altered, but which contains also
  "many original passages which the greater maturity of the author's
  judgment induced him to expunge."</p>

  <p>I know only of two manuscripts of the Creed of Piers Ploughman, one in
  the British Museum (MS. Reg. 18, B. XVII.), the other in the Library of
  Trinity College, Cambridge, both on paper, and written long after the
  date of the printed editions, from which they appear to have been
  copied.</p>

  <p>The first printed edition of the Vision was that of Robert Crowley, in
  1550; and it was so favourably received, that there is reason for
  believing that no less than three editions (or rather three impressions<a
  name="NtA_20" href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>) were sold in the course
  of the year. It is clear that Crowley had obtained an excellent
  manuscript; the printer has changed the orthography at will, and has
  evidently altered a word at times, but on the whole this printed text
  differs very little from the one we now publish.</p>

  <p>Three years after the appearance of the Vision, another printer,
  Reynold Wolfe, published the first edition of the Creed, in the same form
  as Crowley's edition of the Vision.<a name="NtA_21"
  href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

  <p>After the stormy reign of Mary was past, in the beginning of that of
  Elizabeth, the call for a new edition, and perhaps the destruction of
  many copies of the old one, led the well-known printer Owen Rogers to
  reprint the Vision and the Creed together.<a name="NtA_22"
  href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> The impression was probably large, for
  it is still by no means a rare book. It was evidently much read during
  the reign of Elizabeth, and is not unfrequently alluded to by the writers
  of that age.</p>

  <p>No other edition of this popular poem appeared, until it was published
  by Dr. Whitaker, in 1813,<a name="NtA_23"
  href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> from a manuscript then in the
  possession of Mr. Heber,<a name="NtA_24"
  href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> which contained the second text,
  written in a rather broad provincial dialect. This edition was printed in
  black-letter, in a very large and expensive form. In 1814, a reprint of
  the old edition of the Creed was published in the same form, as a
  companion to the Vision. It is not generally known that Dr. Whitaker
  projected an edition of the same text and paraphrase which are given in
  his 4to edition, in 8vo, with Roman type instead of black-letter. After a
  few sheets had been composed, the design was abandoned, as it is said, in
  favour of the larger form. A copy of the proof sheets, formerly belonging
  to Mr. Haslewood, is now in the possession of Sir Frederick Madden. I am
  told that a rival edition was also begun, but not persevered in.</p>

  <p>An attempt at a modernization, or rather a translation, of Piers
  Ploughman, was made in the earlier years of the present century, but only
  a few specimens appear to have been executed. The following lines, which
  possess some merit (though not very literal or correct), are the modern
  version the author proposed to give of ll. <a href="#vs2847">2847</a>-<a
  href="#vs2870">2870</a> of the poem. They were communicated to me by Sir
  Henry Ellis.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgdq">"Next <span class="sc">Avarice</span> came: but how he look'd, to say,</p>
      <p>Words do I want that rightly shall portray:</p>
      <p>Like leathern purse his shrivell'd cheeks did shew,</p>
      <p>Thick lipp'd, with two blear eyes and beetle brow:</p>
      <p>In a torn threadbare tabard was he clad,</p>
      <p>Which twelve whole winters now in wear he had;</p>
      <p>French scarlet 'twas, its colour well it kept,</p>
      <p>So smooth that louse upon its surface crept."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It will be necessary, in conclusion, to say a few words on the edition
  now offered to the public. Without taking into consideration the
  inaccuracies and imperfections of Whitaker's edition, its inconvenient
  size and high price made it altogether inaccessible to the general
  reader; and there appeared to be a wish for one in a more convenient and
  less expensive form. At the same time it was desired that a good text of
  a work so important for the history of our language and literature should
  be selected. Dr. Whitaker was not well qualified for this undertaking; he
  also laboured under many disadvantages; he had access to only three
  manuscripts, and those not very good ones; and he has not chosen the best
  text even of those. Unless he had some reason to believe that the book
  was originally written in a particular dialect, he ought to have given a
  preference to that among the oldest manuscripts which presents the purest
  language; but we cannot allow that manuscript to be chosen on a ground so
  capricious as "that the orthography and dialect in which it is written
  approach very near to that semi-Saxon jargon in the midst of which the
  editor was brought up, and which he continues to hear daily spoken on the
  confines of Lancashire, and the West Riding of the county of York."
  (Pref.) This could not have been the language employed by a monk of
  Malvern.</p>

  <p>The present editor has endeavoured, in the leisure moments which he
  has been able to snatch from other employments, to supply the deficiency
  as well, and in as unassuming manner, as he could. He has chosen for his
  text a manuscript belonging to the valuable library of Trinity College,
  Cambridge (where its shelf-mark is B. 15, 17), because it appears to him
  to be the best and oldest manuscript now in existence. It is a fine folio
  manuscript, on vellum, written in a large hand, undoubtedly contemporary
  with the author of the poem, and in remarkably pure English, with
  ornamented initial letters. His object has been to give the poem as
  popular a form as is consistent with philological correctness. He has
  added a few notes which occurred to him in the course of editing the
  text, and which he hopes may render the meaning and allusions sometimes
  clearer to the general reader, for whom more especially they are
  intended. They might have been enlarged and rendered more complete, if he
  had been master of sufficient leisure to enable him to <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads 'untertake'.">undertake</span>
  extensive researches. But there are allusions, as well as words, in both
  poems to which it would be difficult at present to give any certain
  explanation. It has been thought advisable to give in the notes the
  important variations of the second text, from Dr. Whitaker's edition; and
  a few readings are added from a second manuscript in Trinity College
  Library (R. 3, 14). The editor has hoped to add to the utility of the
  book by a copious glossary. He has been unwillingly obliged to leave a
  few words without explanation; all our early alliterative poetry abounds
  in difficult words. In this point he has to acknowledge the kind
  assistance of Sir Frederick Madden, whom no person equals in profound
  knowledge of English glossography, and than whom no one is more generous
  to advise and assist those who are in need of his aid. To Sir Henry
  Ellis, who kindly lent him his own manuscript notes on Piers Ploughman,
  the editor also owes his grateful acknowledgments; and he regrets that at
  the time he received them the notes were already so far printed as to
  hinder him from making as much use of them as he could have wished.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><a name="Nt_1" href="#NtA_1">[1]</a> See the "Apocalypsis Goliæ" and
  other pieces in the poems of Walter Mapes; the Order of Fair Ease in the
  Political Songs, and the Poems of Rutebeuf; and, in English, the
  remarkable "Poem on the Evil Times of Edward II." in the appendix to the
  Political Songs. The Poem entitled the Order of Fair Ease bears some
  resemblance to the <i>Abbaye de Theleme</i> of Rabelais.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_2" href="#NtA_2">[2]</a> This sentiment was perpetuated in
  a numerous class of ballads, in which the monarch is represented as
  thrown incognito among the lower classes, as listening to their
  expressions of loyalty and to the tale of their sufferings. See the "Tale
  of King Edward and the Shepherd" in Hartshorne's <i>Ancient Metrical
  Tales</i>; "The King and the Barker," in Ritson's <i>Pieces of Ancient
  Popular Poetry</i>; "The King and the Miller," and "King Edward IV. and
  the Tanner of Tamworth," in <i>Percy's Reliques</i>; &amp;c. The earliest
  known form of this tale is the story of "Henry II. and the Cistercian
  Abbot," printed from Giraldus Cambrensis in the <i>Reliquiæ Antiquiæ</i>,
  vol. ii. p. 147.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_3" href="#NtA_3">[3]</a> It was at least a tradition early
  in the sixteenth century (for we have no means now of ascertaining
  whether there were any substantial grounds for the statement), that the
  author was named Robert Longlande (or Langlande), that he was born at
  Cleobury Mortimer in Shropshire, and that (after receiving his education
  at Oxford) he became a monk of Malvern. I do not think, with Tyrwhitt and
  Price, that the name <i>Wil</i>, given in the poem to the dreamer,
  necessarily shows that the writer's name was <i>William</i>; and still
  less that the mention of "Kytte my wif" and "Calote my doghter" (p. 395
  of the present volume), and of the dreamer's having resided at Cornhill,
  refer to the family and residence of the author of the poem. If he were a
  monk (as appears probable by his intimate acquaintance with the
  Scriptures and the Fathers), he would not be married. Sir Frederick
  Madden discovered a very important entry in a hand of the fifteenth
  century on the fly-leaf of a manuscript of Piers Ploughman in the library
  of Trinity College, Dublin, to the following effect&mdash;"Memorandum,
  quod Stacy de Rokayle, pater Willielmi de Langlond, qui Stacius fuit
  generosus, et morabatur in Schiptone under Whicwode, tenens domini Le
  Spenser in comitatu Oxon., <i>qui prædictus Willielmus fecit librum qui
  vocatur Perys Ploughman</i>."&mdash;It would perhaps be not impossible to
  trace the name and history of this Stacy de Rokayle; but till that be
  done, I do not think this memorandum ought to be considered as
  overthrowing the old tradition relating to Robert Longlande. It may be
  mentioned as a remarkable specimen of the patriotism of David Buchanan,
  that he lays claim to the author of Piers Ploughman as a
  Scotchman:&mdash;"Robertus Langland, natione Scotus, professione
  sacerdos, vir ex obscuris ortus parentibus, pius admodum et ingeniosus et
  zelo divinæ gloriæ plenus; inter monachos Benedictinos educatus in
  civitate Aberdonensi, vir æque erat in omni humaniore literatura
  insigniter doctus, et in medicina admodum clarus, pium opus sermone
  vulgare scripsit cui imposuit, || Visionem Petri Aratoris, lib. 1. || Pro
  conjugio sacerdotum. lib. 1. || Claruit anno Christi Redemptoria, 1369.
  Regnante Davide Secundo in Scotia."&mdash;Dav. Buchanan, <i>de
  Scriptoribus Scotis. MS. Bibl. Univ. Edin.</i></p>

  <p><a name="Nt_4" href="#NtA_4">[4]</a> We may mention another historical
  allusion in Piers Ploughman, which seems to involve a chronological
  difficulty; the dry April in the mayoralty of John Chichester, 1. 8567.
  It appears clear that this is an allusion to a remarkable drought in the
  year 1351, which answers precisely to a calculation of the date given in
  the text, in which all the manuscripts that I have consulted agree. But
  the only year in which Chichester is said to have been mayor was 1368-9
  according to some, or 1369-70 according to others. Stowe (as quoted in
  the note on this passage) has altered the text of Piers Ploughman to suit
  the year in which Chichester is known to have been mayor: yet there can
  be little doubt (even from the allusion to the treaty of Bretigny) that
  the poem itself was composed before that date, and therefore the same or
  another Chichester had probably been mayor before.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_6" href="#NtA_6">[6]</a> This terrible calamity was said
  by the astrologers to have been brought about by an extraordinary
  conjunction of Saturn with the other planets, which happened scarcely
  once in a thousand years. An astrologer and physician, who witnessed its
  effects, Symon de Covino, has left a Latin poem on the subject under the
  title <i>De Judicio Solis in Conviviis Saturni</i>, in which he describes
  Saturn as indulging his malevolence towards the human race by obtaining a
  judgment against men for their sins. This opinion is alluded to in Piers
  Ploughman, l. <a href="#vs4453">4453</a>,</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_8" href="#NtA_8">[8]</a> We have a very remarkable proof
  of the popularity of Piers Ploughman with the lower orders (among whom
  probably parts of it were repeated by memory), and of its influence on
  the insurrections of the peasantry in the reign of Richard II., in the
  seditious letter of John Ball to the commons of Essex, preserved by
  Thomas Walsingham (<i>Hist. Angl.</i> p. 275). I am not sure if "John
  <i>Schep</i>" may not contain an allusion to the opening of the poem; but
  the second passage, here printed in Italics, refers evidently to Passus
  VI. and VII., and the third is an allusion to the characters of Do-well
  and Do-best.</p>

  <p>"John <i>Schep</i> sometime Seint Mary priest of Yorke, and now of
  Colchester, graeteth well John Namelesse, and John the Miller, and John
  Carter, and biddeth them that they beware of guyle in borough, and stand
  together in Gods name, and biddeth <i>Piers Plowman goe to his werke</i>,
  and chastise well Hob the robber, and take with you John Trewman, and all
  his fellows, and no moe. John the Miller hath y-ground, smal, small,
  small. The kings sonne of heaven shal pay for all. Beware or ye be woe,
  know your frende fro your foe. Have ynough, and say hoe: <i>And do well
  and better</i>, and flee sinne, and seeke peace and holde you therin, and
  so biddeth John Trewman and all his fellowes."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_9" href="#NtA_9">[9]</a> The mention of Wycliffe and of
  Walter Brute and other circumstances, fix the date of Piers Ploughman's
  Creed with tolerable certainty in the latter years of the reign of
  Richard II. It was probably written very soon after the year 1393, the
  date of the persecution of Walter Brute at Hereford; and from the
  particular allusion to that person we may perhaps suppose that like the
  Vision it was written on the Borders of Wales.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_10" href="#NtA_10">[10]</a> Different circumstances
  connected with this poem (which also appears to have been proscribed, for
  we have no early manuscript of it) lead me to suppose that it was written
  in the reign of Henry IV., when the <i>burning</i> of heretics came into
  fashion, which is alluded to in the following stanza<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="poem">

  known to everybody.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, however, the writer only claims the authorship of the Creed
  in his allegorical character, as the representative of that class of
  satirical writers who were then attacking the monastic orders.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_11" href="#NtA_11">[11]</a> We may enumerate the following
  as specimens of such works published in the sixteenth century. Several
  similar publications appeared in the century following.</p>

  <p>"Pyers Plowmans Exortation vnto the lordes, knights, and burgoysses of
  the parlyament house." 8vo. printed by Anthony Scholoker, in the reign of
  Edward VI.</p>

  <p>"Newes from the North, Otherwise called the Conference between Simon
  Certain, and Pierce Plowman, faithfully collected and gathered by T. F.
  Student." 4to. London, John Allde, 1579.</p>

  <p>"The Plowmans complaint of sundry wicked livers, and especially of the
  bad bringing vp of children; written in verse by R. B. printed for Hugh
  Corne, 1580." 8vo.</p>

  <p>"A goodlye Dialogue and dysputacion between Pyers Ploweman and a
  Popish Preest, c&#x14D;cernynge the Supper of the Lorde." 8vo, without
  date.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_12" href="#NtA_12">[12]</a> Printed in the <i>Reliquiæ
  Antiquæ</i>, vol i. pp. 170-188. On the date of this poem, see the
  <i>Biographia Britannica Literaria</i> (by the editor of the present
  work), Anglo-Saxon period, pp. 395, 396.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_13" href="#NtA_13">[13]</a> Printed in the <i>Altdeutsche
  Blätter</i> von Moriz Haupt und Heinrich Hoffmann, vol. ii. pp. 99-120,
  and in the <i>Reliquiæ Antiquæ</i>, vol. i. pp. 208-227.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_14" href="#NtA_14">[14]</a> Discovered in a MS. at
  Worcester by Sir Thomas Phillipps, who published a small edition of it,
  in folio.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_15" href="#NtA_15">[15]</a> Edited by Sir Frederick
  Madden, for the Society of Antiquaries.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_16" href="#NtA_16">[16]</a> Many instances of this will be
  found in my <i>Specimens of Lyric Poetry</i>, composed in England in the
  reign of Edward the First (Percy Society Publication).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_17" href="#NtA_17">[17]</a> Such as <i>William and the
  Werwolf</i>, edited by Sir Frederick Madden; the <i>Romance of
  Jerusalem</i>; that of <i>Alexander</i>; &amp;c.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_18" href="#NtA_18">[18]</a> MS. Harl. 2253. In this
  manuscript, and in several others which I have seen the rhyming poems in
  short lines, whether in English, Latin, or French, are arranged in this
  manner; and I have met with instances in which part of a poem has been
  arranged in this way, and other parts of the same poem have been arranged
  in short lines, to suit the scribe's convenience. I have a strong
  impression of having met with an early English manuscript in which a
  fragment of alliterative verse was written in short couplets.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_19" href="#NtA_19">[19]</a> <i>Text I.</i> is from the
  edition now offered to the public: <i>Text II.</i> from that edited by
  Dr. Whitaker.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_20" href="#NtA_20">[20]</a> The title of the second
  impression is, "The Vision of Pierce Ploughman, nowe the seconde time
  imprinted by Roberte Crowley, dwellynge in Elye rentes in Holburne.
  Whereunto are added certayne notes and cotations in the mergyne gevynge
  light to the Reader, &amp;c. Imprinted at London by Roberte Crowley,
  dwellyng in Elye rentes in Holburne. The yere of our Lord M.D.L. Cum
  privilegio ad imprimendum solum." 4to, 125 leaves.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_21" href="#NtA_21">[21]</a> The title consists merely of
  the words "Pierce the Ploughman's Crede," upon a tablet in the midst of a
  wood-cut which had evidently been brought from the continent. A
  fac-simile of the most important part of the cut is given in Mr. Payne
  Collier's Bibliographical Catalogue of the Library of Lord Francis
  Egerton, p. 235. The colophon, on a separate leaf, is "Imprinted at
  London. By Reynold Wolfe. Anno Domini M.D.L.III." It consists of 16
  leaves in 4to.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_22" href="#NtA_22">[22]</a> The title of this edition is,
  "The Vision of Pierce Plowman, newlye imprynted after the authours olde
  copy, with a brefe summary of the principall matters set before every
  part called Passus. Wherevnto is also annexed the Crede of Pierce
  Plowman, neuer imprinted with the booke before. ¶ Imprynted at London, by
  Owen Rogers, dwellyng neare vnto great Saint Bartelmewes gate, at the
  sygne of the spred Egle. ¶ The yere of our Lord God, a thousand, fyve
  hundred, thre score and one. The xxi. daye of the Moneth of Februarye.
  Cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum." 4to. This edition is not foliated,
  or paged; and it is remarkable that it is as frequently found without the
  Creed, as with it. This edition of the Creed is also sometimes found
  separate.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_23" href="#NtA_23">[23]</a> Whitaker's edition bears the
  following title,&mdash;"Visio Willielmi de Petro Plouhman, Item Visiones
  ejusdem de Dowel, Dobet, et Dobest. Or, The Vision of William concerning
  Piers Plouhman, and The Visions of the same concerning the Origin,
  Progress, and Perfection of Christian Life, &amp;c. By Thomas Dunham
  Whitaker, LL.D., &amp;c." 4to. London. Murray, 1813.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_24" href="#NtA_24">[24]</a> This manuscript was bought at
  Heber's sale for the British Museum, where it is classed as Additional
  MS. No. 10,574.</p>
